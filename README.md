### 1-Description :page\_facing\_up:

This is a fairly simply Giphy API app upon launching display a jumbotron for our header, an input field that allows
you to create a button and it will named same as user input. And it also include five pre-fab button name after
a few of my favorite athlethes that allows to display up to 10 giphs each. 

Or you can create your own button that will push a new button to the button's array. then on clicking that button 
it will make a title call to the GIPHY API website and populate our page with a max of 10 GIPHs. This is the app
on a nutshell.

This app is simply to showcase the ability to handle API calls to databases like GIPHY, Google Maps, Twitter etc..
to use within my own website and display it as i please.

**Note:** Below is deployed link to the working site.

### 2-Technologies  :computer:

these are the following technologies used to build this app
- HTML
- BootStrap
- CSS
- JQuery

---
### 3-Challenges 

Building this app was fairly easy. The only challenge i faced believe it or not was having my data to display as close
as possible in size to each other. they were coming in very different sizes and was displaying badly and unorderly on 
the web page.

---
### 4-Issues

No major known issue at this point but i will have to enhance design of the web app for sure.

---
### 5-Future Updates

In the future i would like to enhance the design of the app, make it look more intriguing an user friendly.
i would also like to make it display some default giphs upon launching the site instead of waiting for user 
to click on a button to view the first sets of giphs.
